# Project Name

**Author**: Brennan Malone, Yen Xiong Yuan
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations

What hours will you be available to communicate?
Brennan: 24/7 core hours EST 1100 - 2200
Yen: 24/7 core hours EST 1100 - 2200
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack
How often will you take breaks?
On a as needed basis
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
address it talk about it, possibly work additional hours on project.
Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
Yen: Analyzation
Brennan: Design, color, troubleshooting
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
We highlight where are strengths are and utilize them.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Brennan: develop better knowledge on componenet modules and how they interact.
Yen: develop better backend knowledge.
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Work on the same code together, one person drive the other navigate and switch every hour.
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
address it, try resolve it, if that does not work, bring the issue up to the instructor.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
address it, try resolve it, if that does not work, bring the issue up to the instructor.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
be willing to work with eachother and understand that not everyone is at the same skill level.
